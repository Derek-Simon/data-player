I used to devise a path to be a advance data player, like data scientist, data architecturer after [ROUND 1](https://www.derekactions.com/post/23e8e883/#Round-1-Familiar-with-Off).

**AND NOW, I HIDE IT**, 'CUS

My mentor told me not to do it that way in a long long conversation just now. 

*(`date "+%Y-%m-%d"`)  = "2021-12-03"*

He explained quite simple:
 
1. Self study alone is not a good choice than working in a real data platform. 
2. Even growing into a junior data engineer/analytics may takes 4 ~ 6 months instead of what I said 2 months.
3. Based on my Python stacks & SQL skills, I could find a good job now, even if it's entry/elementary level , it's far more import to me to step into the data industry as quick as possible.
4. **data engineering** is huge industry which starts from data collecting to data reporting.


uh...After thinking carefully over his advice, I take it: **I may find a data collecting job now**.

**START SMALL, WHEN YOU WANNA GO BIG and there is no other good way**.

YOU CANNOT JUST IMAGINE IT. GO CLOSER.
